In this repository you will find a side project I am currently working on for a close friend. She is an entrepreneur and decided to fulfill a need here on campus, a delivery food service for campus dining. 

Doing so her business needs an interactive form/website that allows customers to easily get their order in and for her to easily fulfill the order. Using front-end skills and integrating an API, I have coded and will continue to evolve this website to make it not only customized and aesthetically pleasing to my friends' liking.
